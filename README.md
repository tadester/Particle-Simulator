This GitHub repository contains a C++ program for a particle simulation using OpenGL and GLUT. The program simulates the behavior of particles in a 2D space, allowing users to draw particles, apply gravity simulation, and enable a black hole simulation.

Features
Particle Drawing: Users can draw particles by clicking and dragging the mouse in the application window. Particles are represented as red points.

Gravity Simulation: The program offers an option to simulate gravity, making particles fall downward. Users can toggle this simulation on and off.

Black Hole Simulation: Another simulation mode allows users to create a gravitational force resembling a black hole, which attracts particles towards a central point.

Time Step Control: The time step of the simulation can be adjusted, allowing users to speed up or slow down the particle dynamics.

Clear Particles: Users can clear all particles with a key press.

Prerequisites
The code is designed to work with OpenGL and GLUT. It includes platform-specific checks for macOS (Apple) and Windows.

Usage
Compile and run the program.
Use the left mouse button to draw particles in the application window.
Toggle gravity simulation with 'g' or 'G' and black hole simulation with 'b' or 'B'.
Adjust the time step with 't' or 'T' to speed up or slow down the simulation.
Clear all particles with 'o'.
Exit the program using the window's close button.
